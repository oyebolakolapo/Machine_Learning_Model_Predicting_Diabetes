# machine_learning_project-supervised-learning

## Project Outcomes
- Supervised Learning: used supervised learning techniques to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a patient has diabetes or not, based on certain diagnostic measurements.
The project involves three main parts:
- Exploratory data analysis
- Preprocessing and feature engineering
- Training a machine learning model. 
### Duration:
Approximately 3 hours and 20 minutes.
### Project Description:
In this project, I applied supervised learning techniques to a real-world data set and used data visualization tools to communicate the insights gained from the analysis.

The data set for this project is the "Diabetes" dataset from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases 
The project involved the following tasks:

-	Exploratory data analysis and pre-processing: I imported and cleaned the data sets, analyzed and visualized the relationships between the different variables, handled missing values and outliers, and performed feature engineering as needed.
-	Supervised learning: I used the Diabetes dataset to build a machine learning model to predict whether a patient had diabetes or not, using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. We selected three models: LogisticRegression, SVC and RandomForestClassifier and compared their performances.

The ultimate goal of the project was to gain insights from the data sets and communicate these insights to stakeholders using appropriate visualizations and metrics to make informed decisions based on the questions asked.

#### Conclusion
1. LogisticRegression model is the best model for this prediction since it has a maximmum accuracy_score of 0.79.

2. One of the risks during pregnancy is diabetes. It will have to be diagnosed to avoid problems.

3. An increase in glucose levels is strongly correlated to a rise in diabetes.
